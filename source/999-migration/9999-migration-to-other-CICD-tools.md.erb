Because Snap staged pipeline features are unique it is not possible for us to provide seamless migration to other CI/CD tools apart from <%= topic_link 'Migration to GoCD', 'GoCD' %>. However, we can provide an export of all your Snap CI pipeline configuration data to ease your migrations to other tools. Please [get in touch with us](<%= data.links.contact_us %>) for an export of your configurations in this generic format.
 
The following information explains how to use the export we will provide for you. 

## Limitations 

The configuration that is generated is not meant to import directly to any other CI or CD tool. It is meant to provide a readable summary of all the pipeline configurations for a single billing owner.

What is does:

* Exports pipeline and stage names
* Export stacks, language and database information
* Exports pinned commands
* Exports pinned environment variables
* Exports commands executed at each stage
* Exports whether a stage was automated or manually triggered

What it does not do:

* Export secure environment variable values
* Export secure file contents
* Export information about number or size of workers used in each stage

## Instructions to use 

* You can read or copy this file when creating new pipelines in new tools. 
* You will need to refer to your own records for the values of secure environment variables and files. 
* You will need to map Snap CI configuration to your new tool of choice.
