## Deleting a pipeline run

Sometimes you may need to delete a build run, for example, because you accidentally clicked the re-run button multiple times or because you made multiple configuration changes and saved between each one.

To delete a pipeline run, click the trashcan icon on the build commit. You will see an alert that says "Your pipeline is scheduled for deletion" before that run of the pipeline is removed. 

For example, if I have pipeline runs 3, 4 and 5 and I click the trashcan icon on build 4, my pipeline dashboard will now show run 3 below run 5. 4 has been deleted.

## Cancelling a stage

You may not want to completely delete a pipeline run, sometimes you just want to cancel the stage. 

To do so, click the red icon on the face of the pipeline stage that is currently running, and the stage will show that it has been cancelled.
