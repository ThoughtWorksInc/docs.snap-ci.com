We recommend you to add files such as ssh keys and certificates as <%= topic_link 'Deployment Pipeline#secure-files', 'secure files' %>. It can be done in your project configuration screen. There, you'll be able to specify the file name, location, permissions and it's content.

Say for example that you need access to a private repository on Github to fetch some dependency on your build. You can add a access key by creating a secure file and placing it on the `${HOME}/.ssh` folder.

You can also use it to run your custom commands.
