We recommend you to add files such as ssh keys and certificates as <%= topic_link 'Deployment Pipeline#secure-files', 'secure files' %>. It can be done in your project configuration screen. There, you'll be able to specify the file name, location, permissions and it's content.

Say for example that you need access to a private repository on Github to fetch some dependency on your build. You can add a access key by creating a secure file and placing it on the `${HOME}/.ssh` folder.

You can also use it to run your custom commands.

#Below are the steps to generate SSH key and configure in Snap CI:

##Step 1: Check for SSH keys

First, we need to check for existing SSH keys on your computer. Open Terminal and enter:

> ls -al ~/.ssh

> Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist

Check the directory listing to see if you already have a public SSH key. By default, the filenames of the public keys are one of the following:


>  id_dsa.pub 

> id_ecdsa.pub

>  id_ed25519.pub

>  id_rsa.pub


##Step 2: Generate a new SSH key

a. With Terminal still open, copy and paste the text below. Make sure you substitute in your GitHub email address.

> ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"

> Creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label

> Generating public/private rsa key pair.

b. We strongly suggest keeping the default settings as they are, so when you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key", just press Enter to continue.

> Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]

c. You'll be asked to enter a passphrase.

> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]

> Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]

d. After you enter a passphrase, you'll be given the fingerprint, or id, of your SSH key. It will look something like this:

> Your identification has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.

> Your public key has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

> The key fingerprint is:

> 01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:d6:17:a1:7d:f0:68:9d:f0:a2:db your_email@example.com

##Step 3: Add your SSH key to your Snap CI account

a: In the top right corner, click on configuration.

<%= retina_image 'screenshots/getting-started/configuration' %>

b: Click on Edit.

<%= retina_image 'screenshots/getting-started/edit' %>

c: In the Stage basic info section, add a new file to under secure file.

<%= retina_image 'screenshots/getting-started/secure_file' %>

d: Paste your key into the "File content" field.

<%= retina_image 'screenshots/getting-started/ssh-keys' %>

##Step 4: Test the connection

 Add a command in the configuration and run the build something like:

> ssh foo@machine -i my_key 'echo logged in'
