Snap offers you the ability to diagnose a build, and making it a lot more straightforward.
If youâ€™re having trouble with your build - just type `snap-shell` as a command in your pipeline configuration.

When `snap-shell` is active you'll see a _terminal_ icon:

<%= retina_image 'screenshots/getting-started/build-snap-shell-notification' %>

You can find more details on our [blog post](http://blog.snap-ci.com/blog/2014/08/11/introducing-snap-shell).

> **At this time is not possible to run `snap-shell` in stages with multiple
workers.**

##Debugging a stage failure

Sometimes you want to quickly investigate a stage failure. Changing the
configuration and having a whole pipeline run can be cumbersome. Snap  provides
a _stage debug rerun_ functionality which aims to help solve these issues.

When a stage fails you'll see at the bottom left of the stage a bug icon:

<%= retina_image 'screenshots/getting-started/build-stage-debug-icon-highlighted' %>

Clicking on this icon will rerun the stage in debug mode. In this mode Snap
will automatically invoke `snap-shell` if a task fails, giving you a chance to
investigate the problem.
