## Step 1: Check if you already have ssh keys

First, check if you already have an SSH key that you can use. In your terminal, type

~~~ shell
ls -al ~/.ssh
~~~

Check the directory listing to see if you already have a public SSH key. If you see a file named `id_rsa` or `id_dsa`, then skip to <%= topic_link 'How do I add SSH keys to my build?#step-4-add-private-ssh-key-in-snap', 'Step 4' %>.

## Step 2: Generate ssh keys

Type the following into your terminal, and accept the defaults. Don't type a passphrase when asked.

~~~ shell
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
~~~


~~~
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/jsmith/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/home/jsmith/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/jsmith/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/jsmith/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
3a:62:95:ee:b0:c9:52:84:51:ce:03:12:55:65:fe:49 jsmith@mylaptop.local
~~~

The public key is now located in `$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and the private key is located in `$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa`.

## Step 3: Copy the public key onto your remote server

Once you have generated the keypair, you must place the public key onto your remote server.

~~~ shell
ssh user@123.45.56.78 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && echo \"$(cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)\" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 644 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
~~~

## Step 4: Add private ssh key in Snap

Now edit your project configuration, and in the secure files section, click "Add new"

<%= retina_image 'screenshots/getting-started/upload-secure-file' %>

Paste your private key into the "File content" field, and ensure that the file location and permissions are set correctly

<%= retina_image 'screenshots/getting-started/ssh-keys' %>

## Step 5: Test if your ssh key works as expected from Snap

Add a command in your build configuration, so that it looks like

~~~ shell
$ ssh user@123.45.56.78 'hello world'
~~~
