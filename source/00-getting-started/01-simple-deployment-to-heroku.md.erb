A very simple guide to use Snap to deploy a sample application to Heroku. Follow these steps and see your app deployed in a few minutes.


## Get setup

Sign up for:

* <a href="http://www.github.com/">Github</a> and validate your email address

* <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> and choose Ruby as your primary development langauge

* <a href="http://www.snap-ci.com/">Snap CI</a> and authorize Snap CI to access your Github account

## Fork the sample repository

* Login to Github and fork <a href="https://github.com/snap-ci-examples/snapci-ruby-heroku">snapci-ruby-heroku</a>

* You should now see the snapci-ruby-heroku as one of your Github repositories as: github-userid/snapci-ruby-heroku

## Add forked repository to Snap CI

* Go to <a href="http://www.snap-ci.com/">Snap CI</a>

* Add the snapci-ruby-heroku build. The build should start and run the two default stages - FastFeedback and Integration.

## Customise your build

* Select “Customize it here”
* From the build pipeline screen click on the "Add Stage" button
* From the commonly used stages click on “Deploy” and select “Ruby”
* Then select “Basic” under “Heroku”
* Supply your Heroku credentials
* Specify an application name. Don't use upper case characters and make it unique (we suggest you include your user ID)
* Save the configuration

## Your app is deployed to Heroku using Snap CI

* Snap CI will build and deploy your app to Heroku
* Navigate to your new app (e.g. heroku-app-name.heroku.com).
* Celebrate!
