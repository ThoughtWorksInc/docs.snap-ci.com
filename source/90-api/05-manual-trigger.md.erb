Snap allows you to trigger new pipelines and existing manual stages via the API.

## Trigger new pipeline

Triggers a new pipeline from the latest revision on the specified branch.

`POST /project/:owner/:repository/branch/:branch_name/trigger`{:.api-method-url}

For Pull request:

`POST /project/:owner/:repository/pull/:pull_request_counter/trigger`{:.api-method-url}

**Parameters**

{:.api-params}
**Name**|**Type**|**Description**
--------|--------|---------------
 payload| object | A list of environment variables to be submitted along with the build. These variables will override any existing variables with the same name. |

In case you provide a payload, it is required to include the `Content-type: application/json` header, otherwise Snap will return status `415`.
