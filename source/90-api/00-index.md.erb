Snap API provides a way to query and perform operations that you would otherwise use the web interface for. All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from `api.snap-ci.com` domain. All data is sent and received as JSON.

## Authentication

All APIs require you to authenticate yourself using your API key. You may find the API key in the [user settings](https://snap-ci.com/settings/api_key). If authentication fails, Snap will return status `404` or `401`.

## Basic authentication

Snap uses basic authentication. To authenticate you need to provide your username and API key.

<%= render_api_example 'api/basic-authentication',
      method: :get,
      url:    'https://api.snap-ci.com/'
%>

## Current Version

By default, all requests receive the **v1** version of the API. It is recommended to explicitly request this version via the `Accept` header.

`Accept: <%= data.api.current_version %>`{:.api-method-url}

If you specify an unsupported, `Accept` header, Snap will respond with the current default JSON representation of the resource.

>**Important**: The default version of the API may change in the future. If you care about the stability of the API, make sure that you are requesting a specific version in the `Accept` header as shown in the example above.

## Pagination

Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 25 items by default. The `next` and `previous` page links, if applicable are included in the response body in the `_links` section.

<%= render_api_example 'api/pagination',
      method: :get,
      url:    'https://api.snap-ci.com/project/snap-ci/api-docs-sample-repository/branch/master/pipelines?less_than_counter=30'
%>

## Rate limiting

By default, all API calls are limited to a rate of 1 request/second per IP address on average. This means in any window of n seconds, you can make at most n API calls. Calls made over this rate will fail with a 503 error code.
