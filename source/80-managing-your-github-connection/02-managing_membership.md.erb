When a new repository is added in Snap, it will automatically sync all the collaborators from Github.
You may optionally force a sync with GitHub to ensure that project membership in Snap are in line with collaborations on GitHub.

> **Note** :
Recently, GitHub introduced some changes to the Organizations which are managed with the effect that the Github organizations owners also need to be admin collaborator on the repository.

To be able to add a new repository on Snap, make sure you are part of a GitHub team that can administer the repository. This is due to recent Github changes in the way they deal with permissions.

# To perform a sync

* Click on **Configuration > Collaborators** link on the build history page to configure your project.

## Remove collaborators from Snap

To remove a collaborator from your builds, you will need to remove them from github collaborator and then re-sync them on Snap as mentioned above.

## Transfer billing ownership of repository

Below are the steps to transfer billing owner of repository to another user :

1. Click on your user profile and then select settings - available on the top right corner of Snap dashboard.

2. Under "repositories" tab, Click on the repo which is billed to you and you want to transfer. This will take you that repo page.

3. Once you are on the repo page, you'll see an option to "transfer billing" , click on that and select the user to whom you want to transfer.

  	           <%= retina_image 'screenshots/github-collaboration/transfer' %>



4. Once you transfer the ownership, user will get an email notification to accept/decline the request (which is valid for 48 hours). After accepting the request, the billing ownership will be transferred to that user.

> **Note** :
> If you are a paying user, transferring ownership of repositories from a paying account to another user does not transfer your subsciption. The new user will need to purchase a Snap plan and the previous user will need to cancel their existing plan. 

> **Note** :
> **You cannot transfer repos which are owned by that user.**

## Snap user roles and permissions :

User roles determine what users can see and do in Snap.

There are four types of user who may interact with Snap:

  **Billing owner** - A Billing owner is the owner of repository/organization on GitHub and owns the account on Snap. Billing owner can do:

+ Repair connectivity

+ Test connection

+ Transfer Billing Owner to another Snap Admin user.

+ Upgrade/Renew/Cancel plan subscription.

+ All Billing Owner are Admins by default, so they have Snap Admin privileges.

**Admins** - A Snap Admin is a user who has admin access to a given repository on GitHub and have below privileges:

+ Clone repository

+ Sync collaborators

+ Delete projects

+ They will also have collaborators privileges

 **Collaborators** - Collaborators on Snap can:

 + Edit/Pause pipeline
