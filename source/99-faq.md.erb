### I need a package to be installed on Snap. Can I do that?

Absolutely! Snap supports full `sudo` access. You may install your favorite package by configuring a setup command to install the package you need `sudo yum install --assumeyes package-name`

Base CentOS and EPEL repositories are already on the systems, but if you'd like other repositories to be enabled, you can do so. For e.g. to enable the popular *Les RPM de Remi* repository `sudo yum install --assumeyes http://rpms.famillecollet.com/enterprise/remi-release-6.rpm`

### I need to extensively re-configure the build machine. Can I do that?

Absolutely! If you need to perform extensive configuration by installing lots of packages and lots of configuration - we recommend you do it using [chef](http://www.getchef.com/), [puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/), [ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) or whatever else you prefer.

### Do you support language X?

You can check it out in our <%= topic_link "Languages", "languages page" %>. If you'd like to see your favorite language being supported by Snap, then [contact us](<%= data.links.contact_us %>). See <%= topic_link "The CI Environment", "the CI environment" %> for more on the specifics for each platform.

### How do I remove or delete a build from my dashboard?

You can unwatch a build and it will no longer appear on your dashboard. Just click on the build and select unwatch on the top right.

### Can I get a specific version of a language or build tool?

See <%= topic_link "The CI Environment", "the CI environment" %> for the list of versions we support. If your version is not listed,  please [contact us](<%= data.links.contact_us %>)

### Do you support database X? How do I connect on it?

We currently support MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite3. You can also use external services such as MongoHQ easily. We plan to add support for a few other data-stores very soon. If you'd like to see your favorite database on that list, then [contact us](<%= data.links.contact_us %>). See <%= topic_link "The CI Environment", "the CI environment" %> for what is supported.

Learn more details about the available <%= topic_link 'databases', 'databases and datastores' %>.

### Do you support deployments to platform X?

We currently support out-of-the-box deployments to Heroku. However, most platforms support deployment using some CLI tools. You can configure a stage in Snap to invoke these tools or scripts to perform deployments. We have teams deploying to HP Cloud, Amazon AWS and other platforms using Snap.

### Does the X-Window system run by default?

Yes! Snap runs `xvfb` with a resolution of `1280x1024x16` and makes a `DISPLAY` variable available to your builds. If you're running GUI testing tools, you may want to checkout our guide on <%= topic_link "Testing with browsers", "browser testing" %>.

### Why does Snap need read/write access to my repos?

We know that it seems a lot, but we can <%= topic_link 'Revoking privileges granted to Snap CI', 'explain' %> the need of each one.
