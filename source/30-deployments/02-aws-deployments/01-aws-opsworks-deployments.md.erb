Snap provides a quick and easy way to deploy simple apps using OpsWorks.

To get started

* Edit your project configuration
* Select the "Deploy" recipes
* Then select the "Basic OpsWorks" recipe
* Define some secure environment variables to hold your AWS credentials `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
* Tweak the command to change the APP ID argument to match your application. You can find the APP ID from your [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/home).
